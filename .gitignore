# semiSecretFiles aren't really secret; they're generated from public GitHub
# data when the website is built. Having a separate directory + only committing
# an example file to the repo is an effort to minimize access to the convenient
# list of detailed ResBaz participants' info. If you find development with
# example data annoying, you can manually download the auto-generated files from
# the published site
