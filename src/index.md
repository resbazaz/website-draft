## Related Community Events

### Code Commons

**What**: Code Commons provides a physical space for community and collaboration. Join us to share experience, learn, mentor, discover opportunities, and work on your programming projects in the presence of others doing the same.

Code Commons also aims to provide the best aspects of workplace culture for people who are otherwise isolated from other developers. This includes (but isnâ€™t limited to) people working on free, libre, open-source software (FLOSS), and software for public service missions.

### Tucson Python Meetup

**What**: The goal of this group is to encourage more mingling, learning, and sharing ideas within the Tucson Python community. Everybody is welcome, no matter what your level of Python experience. Activities include presentations and workshops on everything from how to use Python to control the lights in your home, to building web applications which can scale to millions of users.

## TODO: finish and delete this stuff

- Port Styles
- Main page content
  - Borrow existing quicklinks pattern for people + pics, then delete `_data/quicklinks.yaml` and `_includes/partials/content.html`
- Duplicate (or replace?) blog with yearly festival page
  - for consistent urls, should use `/resbaz/resbazTucson2020`, `resbaz/Arizona2023`, etc
- Migrate existing festival pages
- Replicate old styles... kinda
  - I might take some liberties here
