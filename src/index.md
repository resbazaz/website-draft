## TODO: finish and delete this stuff

- Port Styles
- Main page content
  - Borrow existing quicklinks pattern for people + pics, then delete `_data/quicklinks.yaml` and `_includes/partials/content.html`
- Duplicate (or replace?) blog with yearly festival page
  - for consistent urls, should use `/resbaz/resbazTucson2020`, `resbaz/Arizona2023`, etc
- Migrate existing festival pages
- Replicate old styles... kinda
  - I might take some liberties here
